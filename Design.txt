Design:

If the file is of 52 bytes of less, its stored in the node of the file itself.

The modifications were done in fs.c file, specifically: in readi(), writei() 
and trunci() fucntions. In readi(), the file is directly read from the inode's
 address pointers if the file size is less than 52 bytes. 

In sys_open(), a handler for the O_SMALLFILE flag was added.

In create(), the T_SMALLFILE type is added to the new file if the O_SMALLFILE
 flag is set.

In writei(), the file is written into the address blocks if the file is less
 than 52 bytes. If more than 52 bytes are written the file is changed into the
 default file type and the write proceeds as normal.

In readi(), the data is read and returned directly from the inode struct
 without a call to bmap.  Attempt to read more than 52 bytes will be truncated.
 
In trunci(), the blocks corresponding to the direct and 
 indirect pointers are not removed if the files are of the type T_SMALLFILE.
