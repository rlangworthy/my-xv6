The script in project1runtest.sh sets up and runs tests on mysh.c

It copies echo from /bin/echo and uses that as a testing function.
The tests run through various arrangements of the sequence and parentheses operators

Each test is a list of echo commands, where the output should be
First
Second
Third
Fourth
Fifth
if the list is parsed and passed successfully.
